# Prework - Introduction

Submitted by: **Prisha Hemani**

**Introduction** is an app that displays a personal introduction with an image, labels, and a button. Users can tap the button to change the background color and the text color dynamically, making it an interactive “hello world” style personal app.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Additional Features

- [x] Users see an image of R2-D2 at the top of the screen
- [x] Tapping the button also changes the color of the introduction text
- [x] Custom fonts and text styling applied to labels


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

This app was designed as a simple personal introduction with interactive elements. The idea was to practice:
- Connecting UI elements to Swift code (IBOutlets and IBActions)
- Using functions to generate random colors
- Updating both the background and text colors dynamically
- Experimenting with fonts, images, and layout in Storyboard

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- Initially creating an IBAction instead of just an IBOutlet
- Understanding how to randomize colors for both background and labels
- Making sure the image scales correctly without distortion
- Figuring out how to push the project to GitHub after local repository issues
